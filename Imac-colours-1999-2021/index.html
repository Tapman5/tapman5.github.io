<h1>Imac G3</h1>
<p>The iMac G3, originally released as the iMac, is a series of Macintosh personal computers developed by Apple under the tenure of Apple's interim CEO and cofounder Steve Jobs after his return to the financially troubled company.

The iMac was a huge success for Apple, revitalizing the company and influencing competitors' product designs. It played a role in abandoning legacy technologies like the floppy disk, serial ports, and Apple Desktop Bus in favor of Universal Serial Bus. The product line was updated throughout 1998 until 2001 with new technology and colors, eventually being replaced by the iMac G4 and eMac.</p>

<h1>Imac 2021</h1>
<p>Easy to learn. Astoundingly powerful. And designed to let you work, play, and create in ways you never imagined. It’s the computer that comes packed with apps that are ready to go right out of the box. Free, regular software updates keep things up to date and running smoothly. And if you already have an iPhone, it feels familiar from the moment you turn it on.


With Mac, there’s no complicated setup process. Sign in to your iCloud account, and information from your iPhone or iPad appears automatically. Use Migration Assistant to transfer your settings, user accounts, and more in a snap. And if you have questions or need help, Apple Support is always just an online chat, phone call, or in‑store appointment away.
